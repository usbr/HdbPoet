HDB POET
=====

This is the source code for HDB POET (Hydrologic Database - Perusal Or Editing Tool ), a desktop application used to view, query, edit, manage, and analyze data within a Reclamation Hydrologic Database (HDB). HDB is a relational database management system built on an Oracle database platform and is used to store hydrologic data for record keeping, operations, and modeling purposes.

HDB POET uses several licensed components for connecting to the database and for displaying data in a tabular and graphical format. As such, you may not distribute HDB POET (the Software) as part of libraries, components, or frameworks. You may not use the Software components within a development environment without purchasing the appropriate licenses from [Devart](https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/universal/)(DB Connection Engine), [Steema](https://www.steema.com/product/net)(Graphing Engine), and [SpreadsheetGear](http://www.spreadsheetgear.com/)(Embedded Spreadsheet). You may help us develop HDB POET by compiling the source code using Open-Source libraries as stand-ins for the licensed components; a brief guide on how to do this can be found at [this Wiki page](https://github.com/usbr/HdbPoet/wiki/Compiling-Open-Source).
